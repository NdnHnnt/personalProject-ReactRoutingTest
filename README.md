# React Routing with Native Backend

This project serves as a practical guide for learning how to implement routing in a React application using Vite based on [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)

## Features

- **Routing**: The project demonstrates how to set up routing in a React application using the Vite build tool. You'll learn how to create multiple pages and navigate between them seamlessly.


- **Component Structure**: Explore a well-organized component structure that showcases best practices for separating concerns and maintaining a clear codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NdnHnnt/personalProject-testReactRouting.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:
   ```
   cd test-react-routing
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the application and provide you with a local development URL (usually http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173).

5. **Explore the Code**: Open the project in your favorite code editor. Navigate through the files and explore how routing is implemented using React Router, and how API integration is handled to fetch and display data.

6. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the components, routes, and API calls to experiment with different scenarios. This project serves as a playground for learning, so don't hesitate to make changes and observe the outcomes.
